## Packages
framer-motion | For smooth fade transitions between tabs and UI animations

## Notes
- Using a custom Canvas-based implementation for the particle background to keep performance high and dependencies low.
- The application uses a single-page dashboard layout with internal state for tab switching as requested (Home, Gaming, Browser, App, More).
- Fonts selected: 'Orbitron' for the futuristic headers and 'Inter' for clean body text.
